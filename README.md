# CleanSFML 👔

It is a personal project based on the **C** library **CSFML**.

## Goal 🎓
The main goal is to add a lot of useful functions to make more easy game or UI development for the CSFML users.
Feel free to contribute with some funny function such as:
    - Particles effects
    - Text effect
    - Light management
    - Enhanced collision effect
    - ✨
Some examples are in the CleanTest folder to help user see how to use te functions.

## .Usage 👤
Notice that for now the project is not in a package form.
So the main way to use it is to compile the project with the source files themselves.
You just have to include the "clean_sfml.h" in to your project.
By the way you will not need to include the other common headers for the CSFML...
    Thanks to NemesisX1 🤓.

## .Run the CleanTest project 👏
The CleanTest project is a small project to show the usage of the functions set in the projects.
  
  - *Usage*
    Make sure you have the complete CSFML package available on your OS.
    
         $> make re
         $> ./test
